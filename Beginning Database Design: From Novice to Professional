Ch.1 What Can Go Wrong

general overview of the book, nothign special

1. how the data was gather should be seperate from how it should be stored.
2. brief overview on normal form (without mentioning the jargon)
3. database shouldn't be designed to serve the requirement of a single report,
    report requirement change all the time. Instead it should design according to the data itself.

Ch.2 Guided Tour of the Development Process
1. The important thing is to understand the data that are going to support task
and other likely task, aka "data indepednence"
2. define real world problem statment using UML
3. A table in database is actually a "class" object in software engineering,
    with each "column"/"field" as "attribute"/"properties". There is no "method" to a table
    since it is mainly for data storage.
4. Hence each table should relate to just one thing, and do it exceptionally well.
    just like a class object.
5. relationships is the way that these class interact with each other. this could be zero / one / many,
    depending on the nature of the relationship.
